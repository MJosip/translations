		"The \"alcohol\" in alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer, and spirits is actually ethanol, or ethyl alcohol. It’s the only type of alcohol that you can drink without causing serious damage to your body.",
		"Alcohol is a depressant. This means that it slows down activity in the brain.",
		"Alcohol has a wide variety of effects. In the brain, it triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that’s associated with pleasure and satisfaction.",
		"Stress relief is another side effect of drinking alcohol. This is caused by an increase in the uptake of another neurotransmitter, called GABA.",
		"Alcohol is among the most commonly misused addictive substances. About 12.7 percent of American adults meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). That’s 1 in 8 adults.",
		"Alcohol is processed in the liver, where enzymes help break down ethanol into acetaldehyde and acetate.",
		"The effects associated with drinking occur when ethanol enters your bloodstream and passes through the membranes of cells in your brain, heart, and other organs.",
		"Men are more likely to use alcohol than women.",
		"Alcohol has different health consequences for men and women. Long-term drinking is more likely to have negative health effects for women compared to men, even if the woman drinks less for a shorter period of time.",
		"Alcohol-attributable deaths are the third-leading preventable cause of death in America. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 88,424 people die from alcohol-related causes each year in the United States.",
		"Alcohol may be nearly as old as civilization. Residues from an alcoholic beverage that dates back to 7,000 to 6,600 B.C. have been found in China.",
		"Archaeologists have found evidence suggesting that the workers who built the Great Pyramids of Giza were paid in beer.",
		"Binge drinking is a pattern of alcohol consumption that involves drinking a lot in a short period of time. For women, four or more drinks in two hours is considered binge drinking. For men, it’s five or more drinks in two hours.",
		"Teens who start drinking before the age of 15 are more likely to develop alcohol dependence later on in life.",
		"Symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) include hallucinations, seizures, and, in severe cases, even death. People who are dependent on alcohol should seek medical assistance to stop drinking.",
		"Culture has a significant influence on how people consume alcohol. A study that explored family drinking in Italy found that Italians who drank at family meals while growing up were less likely to develop unhealthy drinking habits later on in life.",
		"Alcohol use is a significant risk factor for dementia.",
		"Drinking red wine in moderation is believed to be good for the heart. Red wine contains resveratrol, a substance which helps control cholesterol, prevent blood vessel damage, and stop blood clots.",
		"Binge drinking can lead to a hangover the following morning. Hangovers are caused by chemical byproducts created during alcohol processing.",
		"Hormonal changes lead to unpleasant hangover symptoms. For instance, hormonal changes cause you to urinate more, which can lead to dehydration.",
		"Dark liquors, such as red wine or whiskey, are more likely to result in severe hangovers. White or clear liquors are less likely to result in a hangover.",
		"Muscles absorb alcohol faster than fat. As a result, people who have more muscles and less body fat have higher alcohol tolerance."
